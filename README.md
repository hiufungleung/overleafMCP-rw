# Overleaf MCP Server with WRITE Functionality

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides access to Overleaf projects via Git integration. This allows Claude and other MCP clients to read and write LaTeX files, analyze document structure, extract content, and manage Overleaf projects with full Git workflow support.

**Note:** All functionality requires an Overleaf membership with Git access (available with free trial or paid subscription).
